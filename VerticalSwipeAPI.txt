Inspector var-s

a. treshold - when swipe will automatically happen.
example: 
Assume half is chosen, then:
    if half of item is displased and user swipe is done, then item will automatically be swiped
    towards the displacement direction.
    else will return swipe will not happen, instead item will get back.
    Note: behavior can be overriden by speedTreshold.

b. speedTreshold - when swipe average speed exceeds treshold, swipe happens, despite displacement treshold.
    (i.e even if displacement is small, if swipe happend too fast, exceeding treshold, then swipe will happen)

c. changingTime - deltaTime for swipe, i.e affects how fast changing(swiping) element happens after finger removed.

Note: these variables should e adjusted by developer, in order to get desired behavior of panel.
